# JiChan

Japanese CLI dictionary, it's currently only providing kanji search. This project is currently not my priority but I'll implement JMDict database later on.

This app uses the Kanjidic2 database with some additional informations such as common readings and updated JLPT level (you can find the database source [here](https://github.com/luckasRanarison/jichan-db), also the database is converted in sqlite database and Jichan uses Sequelize-typescript for ORM.
